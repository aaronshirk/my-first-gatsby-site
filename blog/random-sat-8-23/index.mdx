Started the day by waking up at a usual time, roughly 5:20am. Our neighborhood has 3 pools, of which I typically swim at pool #2, Woodycreek pool.
This is my third swim this week.

I love starting my day with a swim. And at age 49, this routine is really more about mental health than physical health. I helps center me,
boosts my mood, and makes me a little more tolerant of the frustrations that are sure to come my way as a parent of two young daughters.

Things to do today:

1. Compost
2. Clean kitchen in prep for new groceries
3. Work on my portfolio web site
4. Cook lunch and dinner for the week
5. Clean debris from the backyard

And so it begins.
